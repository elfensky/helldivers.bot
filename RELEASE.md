## 0.2.0 (2025-05-11)

- Change Github Actions to only build for amd64 -> this is so I can properly use the Labels in the Dockerfile, without requiring the use of annotations.

- Added and configured PrismaORM
- Added .example.env file
- Switched whole project to JavaScript (once again I am convinced typescript doesn't actually help, but only put spokes in your wheels).
- Working Docker build with PrismaORM
