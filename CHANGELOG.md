# CHANGELOG

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## 0.3.0 (2025-05-12)

- To be copied from RELEASE.md

## 0.2.0 (2025-05-11)

- Change Github Actions to only build for amd64 -> this is so I can properly use the Labels in the Dockerfile, without requiring the use of annotations. [read more](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#adding-a-description-to-multi-arch-images)
- Added and configured PrismaORM
- Added .example.env file
- Switched whole project to JavaScript (once again I am convinced typescript doesn't actually help, but only put spokes in your wheels).
- Working Docker build with PrismaORM

## 0.1.0 (2025-05-10)

- initialize project with `npx create-next-app@latest`
- Configure next.config.js to use output: 'standalone', which will be used by the container
- Configure Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and .dockerignore to build a working container
- Configure Prettier and make it sort Tailwind CSS classes

- Add README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE
- Add Github Action to manually build the container and push it to Github Container Registry
- Add labels to Dockerfile
- Add some folder structure to the project
    - src/app -> routable content
    - src/components -> reusable components
- Add Github Action to automatically build and push the container to Github Container Registry on every tagged commit, and create a new release on Github.
