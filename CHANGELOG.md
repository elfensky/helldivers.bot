## 0.5.4 (2025-06-08)

- rewrite update logic to avoid having to generate complete season list.

- update route.js & rebroadcast.mjs for new logic
    - working POST /api/h1/rebroadcast
- update route.js & getCampaigns().mjs for new logic
    - working GET /api/h1/campaign
    - working GET /api/h1/campaign?season=[season]

## 0.5.3 (2025-05-31)

- rebroadcast now attempts to fetch data if it's not available locally before erroring out on season (get_snapshots) requests.
    - it will not fetch data for status (get_campaign_status) requests, because that data is continiously updated by the worker.
    - it will not longer check last_updated and trigger automatic updates in after().
        - current campaign's data is continiously updated by the worker.
        - old data will never change, and an update should thus only be triggered manually.
- GET /api/h1/campaign/ -> complete current/latest season data
- GET /api/h1/campaign?season=[season] -> complete specific season data

## 0.5.2 (2025-05-30)

- adjust instrumentation.js
    - to make use of the new update functions to initialize the database with the current campaign

    - add `/api/h1/update` route to test update functionality
    - separate `update` directory

    - separate upsert queries for each data type
        - upsertAttackEvents.mjs
        - upsertCampaigns.mjs
