# TODO

#### 0.5.0

- add instrumentation.js

    - initialize db (migrations, provider, ...)
    - initialize sentry
    - if no data, get current season & snapshot

#### 0.6+

- basic map
    - show captured regions -> yellow
    - show contested region -> red
    - show lost region -> dark
- stats block

#### 0.7+

- generate "events" timeline

    - support "defend events"
    - support "attack events"
    - support "region captures"

- add hover tooltip to map
    - use enums or translation.json for content
    - check wiki for region names
    -
- fix map: contested region (only color in gold when 100% completed, if not 100% completed, the region needs to be red)
- add continious updating to map using SetInterval/SetTimeout

    - this means it needs to be SSR'd but then become reactive.
      Need to figure out how that works with Next.js. Maybe useServerSideProps + useClient?

- add "region under attack" to map
- add "completed" to enemy homeworld

#### 0.8.0 ...

- check for validated email before allow any user action
- add validate email button + on signup send verification email
- add /api/auth/verify/[token] or something like that to verify email
- transform /posts to /reviews
    - add stars (1-5)
    - only allow 1 review per user
- restyle reviews
    - show Username + Review + Date + Stars + ND-JSON for reviews
    -

#### 0.5.0 (2025-04-XX)

- rework/complete the api structure
    - normalized data into separate tables
    - update function that properly updates (normalized) and (overwritten) status and campaigns etc..
        - that function should be called in (after) on each request if update===true
    - /h1/rebroadcast fixes
        - also saves normalized data
        - update works with all request types (case switch)
        - ...
    - /h1/status
        - shows all (historical) defend/attack events for the season (more data than rebroadcast).
